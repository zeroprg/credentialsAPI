# Authentication API (Credentials API ) generated by Reprezen, APIMATIC from RAML--> Swagger--> Spring MVC annotations Java code

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  


Authentification API  (Credentials API) deployed to 
http://credentialsapi.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/CredentialsAPI
H2 Database instance :
http://credentialsapi.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/CredentialsAPI/h2-console

Here there are a few workflows :

## 1) Registration and authnentication (encoding is off for testing sake).
	Register user by  "user:password" as Base64 encode pair (/register)
### POST /register
    Authenticate the user by   "user:password" as Base64 encode pair (/
### POST /auth-password
   Signin by secureToken ( returned in body of /register or  /auth-password end pints)

## 2) Password reset eMail validation  and password update

	Initiate password reset flow (secureToken passed in body)  (/reset-password).  
	It will start eMail validation flow which will redirect to update password screen.
	
### POST /reset-password 

   Call the /validate-by-email endpoint  from eMail link sent by /reset-password endpoint
### GET /validate-by-email
    After successefull secureToken (this token used only for eMail validation) validateion redirect to update password screen post old 'user:password' and newpassword  by Base64 encoded 
### POST /update-password

## 3) Other flows:  "Signout", "Unregister", "PasswordStrength", "Oauth"
	These flows are very atomic , and will be specify after

There is subfolder credentialsAPI_0.0.1 which contains the same API but persistance base on Spring Security Vault 

# API Generation details

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
